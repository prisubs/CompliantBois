A document filed by prosecutors on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York mentions Hernández as part of a group of individuals investigated by the DEA since about 2013 for participating ""in large-scale drug-trafficking and money laundering activities relating to the importation of cocaine into the United States"". Hernández was elected president of Honduras in late 2013. The document is a July 2015 application to the court to compel Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and AOL to give investigators email header information, but not emails\' content, for a number of accounts. Two of the accounts are believed to be of Hernández, the documents says. There is no indication charges have been brought against Hernández. Also included in the request are the email accounts of the president\'s sister Hilda Hernández, his adviser Ebal Díaz and his security minister Julián Pacheco Tinoco. Hilda Hernández, who helped manage the finances of the president\'s political party and his presidential campaign, died in a December 2015 helicopter crash. The request also named four members of the wealthy and politically-connected Rosenthal family. Yani Rosenthal, a former national lawmaker and presidential candidate, pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in 2017 for money laundering for the Cachiros drug trafficking organization. The new court filing is part of the pre-trial motions in the case of Hernandez\'s brother Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernández, who was arrested in 2018 in Miami and accused of scheming for years to bring tons of cocaine into the country.

A document filed by prosecutors on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York mentions Hernández as part of a group of individuals investigated by the DEA since about 2013 for participating ""in large-scale drug-trafficking and money laundering activities relating to the importation of cocaine into the United States"". Hernández was elected president of Honduras in late 2013. The document is a July 2015 application to the court to compel Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and AOL to give investigators email header information, but not emails' content, for a number of accounts. Two of the accounts are believed to be of Hernández, the documents says. There is no indication charges have been brought against Hernández. Also included in the request are the email accounts of the president's sister Hilda Hernández, his adviser Ebal Díaz and his security minister Julián Pacheco Tinoco. Hilda Hernández, who helped manage the finances of the president's political party and his presidential campaign, died in a December 2015 helicopter crash. The request also named four members of the wealthy and politically-connected Rosenthal family. Yani Rosenthal, a former national lawmaker and presidential candidate, pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in 2017 for money laundering for the Cachiros drug trafficking organization. The new court filing is part of the pre-trial motions in the case of Hernandez's brother Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernández, who was arrested in 2018 in Miami and accused of scheming for years to bring tons of cocaine into the country.

""We think it may be the beginning of Beijing\'s attempt to roll out a retaliatory framework,"" said Paul Triolo of the global risk assessment firm Eurasia Group. ""That could include a number of other elements, such as restrictions on rare earth shipments"" — minerals that are crucial in many mobile devices and electric cars made by U.S. companies. The move follows additional measures this week that deepen the bite of U.S. sanctions imposed on Huawei in mid-May amid an escalating trade war, whose backdrop is the two powers\' struggle for long-term technological and economic dominance. Several leading U.S.-based global technology standards-setting groups announced restrictions on Huawei\'s participation in their activities under the U.S. Commerce Department restrictions, which bar the sale and transfer of U.S. technology to Huawei without government approval. Such groups are vital battlegrounds for industry players, who use them to try to influence the development of next-generation technologies in their favor. Excluding Huawei would put the company at serious disadvantage against rivals outside China. Also Friday, The Financial Times said the company had ordered employees to cancel technical meetings with Americans and sent home U.S. employees working at its Chinese headquarters. Huawei is the world\'s No. 1 network equipment provider and second-largest smartphone maker. U.S. officials claim Huawei is legally beholden to China\'s ruling Communists, which could use the company\'s products for cyberespionage, though the U.S. has presented no evidence of intentional spying.

China draws up list of ""unreliables"" In an ominous but vague warning, China said Friday that it was drawing up a list of ""unreliable"" companies, organizations and individuals for targeting in what could signal retaliation for U.S. sanctions on the Chinese tech powerhouse Huawei. ""We think it may be the beginning of Beijing's attempt to roll out a retaliatory framework,"" said Paul Triolo of the global risk assessment firm Eurasia Group. ""That could include a number of other elements, such as restrictions on rare earth shipments"" — minerals that are crucial in many mobile devices and electric cars made by U.S. companies. The move follows additional measures this week that deepen the bite of U.S. sanctions imposed on Huawei in mid-May amid an escalating trade war, whose backdrop is the two powers' struggle for long-term technological and economic dominance. Several leading U.S.-based global technology standards-setting groups announced restrictions on Huawei's participation in their activities under the U.S. Commerce Department restrictions, which bar the sale and transfer of U.S. technology to Huawei without government approval. Such groups are vital battlegrounds for industry players, who use them to try to influence the development of next-generation technologies in their favor. Excluding Huawei would put the company at serious disadvantage against rivals outside China. Also Friday, The Financial Times said the company had ordered employees to cancel technical meetings with Americans and sent home U.S. employees working at its Chinese headquarters. Huawei is the world's No. 1 network equipment provider and second-largest smartphone maker. U.S. officials claim Huawei is legally beholden to China's ruling Communists, which could use the company's products for cyberespionage, though the U.S. has presented no evidence of intentional spying.

China draws up list of ""unreliables"" In an ominous but vague warning, China said Friday that it was drawing up a list of ""unreliable"" companies, organizations and individuals for targeting in what could signal retaliation for U.S. sanctions on the Chinese tech powerhouse Huawei. ""We think it may be the beginning of Beijing\'s attempt to roll out a retaliatory framework,"" said Paul Triolo of the global risk assessment firm Eurasia Group. ""That could include a number of other elements, such as restrictions on rare earth shipments"" — minerals that are crucial in many mobile devices and electric cars made by U.S. companies. The move follows additional measures this week that deepen the bite of U.S. sanctions imposed on Huawei in mid-May amid an escalating trade war, whose backdrop is the two powers\' struggle for long-term technological and economic dominance. Several leading U.S.-based global technology standards-setting groups announced restrictions on Huawei\'s participation in their activities under the U.S. Commerce Department restrictions, which bar the sale and transfer of U.S. technology to Huawei without government approval. Such groups are vital battlegrounds for industry players, who use them to try to influence the development of next-generation technologies in their favor. Excluding Huawei would put the company at serious disadvantage against rivals outside China. Also Friday, The Financial Times said the company had ordered employees to cancel technical meetings with Americans and sent home U.S. employees working at its Chinese headquarters. Huawei is the world\'s No. 1 network equipment provider and second-largest smartphone maker. U.S. officials claim Huawei is legally beholden to China\'s ruling Communists, which could use the company\'s products for cyberespionage, though the U.S. has presented no evidence of intentional spying.

Richard Forno, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (THE CONVERSATION) The people of Baltimore are beginning their fifth week under an electronic siege that has prevented residents from obtaining building permits and business licenses – and even buying or selling homes. A year after hackers disrupted the city’s emergency services dispatch system, city workers throughout the city are unable to, among other things, use their government email accounts or conduct routine city business. In this attack, a type of malicious software called ransomware has encrypted key files, rendering them unusable until the city pays the unknown attackers 13 bitcoin, or about US$76,280. But even if the city were to pay up, there is no guarantee that its files would all be recovered; many ransomware attacks end with the data lost, whether the ransom is paid or not. Similar attacks in recent years have crippled the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk and local, county and state governments across the U.S. and Canada. These types of attacks are becoming more frequent and gaining more media attention. Speaking as a career cybersecurity professional, the technical aspects of incidents like this are but one part of a much bigger picture. Every user of technology must consider not only threats and vulnerabilities, but also operational processes, potential points of failure and how they use technology on a daily basis. Thinking ahead, and taking protective steps, can help reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents on both individuals and organizations.

Richard Forno, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (THE CONVERSATION) The people of Baltimore are beginning their fifth week under an electronic siege that has prevented residents from obtaining building permits and business licenses – and even buying or selling homes. A year after hackers disrupted the city’s emergency services dispatch system, city workers throughout the city are unable to, among other things, use their government email accounts or conduct routine city business. In this attack, a type of malicious software called ransomware has encrypted key files, rendering them unusable until the city pays the unknown attackers 13 bitcoin, or about US$76,280. But even if the city were to pay up, there is no guarantee that its files would all be recovered; many ransomware attacks end with the data lost, whether the ransom is paid or not. Similar attacks in recent years have crippled the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk and local, county and state governments across the U.S. and Canada. These types of attacks are becoming more frequent and gaining more media attention. Speaking as a career cybersecurity professional, the technical aspects of incidents like this are but one part of a much bigger picture. Every user of technology must consider not only threats and vulnerabilities, but also operational processes, potential points of failure and how they use technology on a daily basis. Thinking ahead, and taking protective steps, can help reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents on both individuals and organizations.

Richard Forno, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (THE CONVERSATION) The people of Baltimore are beginning their fifth week under an electronic siege that has prevented residents from obtaining building permits and business licenses – and even buying or selling homes. A year after hackers disrupted the city’s emergency services dispatch system, city workers throughout the city are unable to, among other things, use their government email accounts or conduct routine city business. In this attack, a type of malicious software called ransomware has encrypted key files, rendering them unusable until the city pays the unknown attackers 13 bitcoin, or about US$76,280. But even if the city were to pay up, there is no guarantee that its files would all be recovered; many ransomware attacks end with the data lost, whether the ransom is paid or not. Similar attacks in recent years have crippled the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk and local, county and state governments across the U.S. and Canada. These types of attacks are becoming more frequent and gaining more media attention. Speaking as a career cybersecurity professional, the technical aspects of incidents like this are but one part of a much bigger picture. Every user of technology must consider not only threats and vulnerabilities, but also operational processes, potential points of failure and how they use technology on a daily basis.

David Campbell, Binghamton University, State University of New York (THE CONVERSATION) The Binghamton University students taking a philanthropy class I’ve been teaching for years have made more than US$150,000 in grants to local charities since 2009. Because giving away money is a rewarding experience, the course has a long waitlist. In 2019, I noticed that something had changed. The students began to wonder whether giving away money might not be all unicorns and rainbows, but – at least sometimes – a bad thing. After they made their grants to help immigrants, address the opioid epidemic and provide locally grown food to poor families, one student nonetheless wrote in her final paper, “There is a lot of negativity that surrounds philanthropy.” It summed up a sentiment being voiced more often. After billionaire investor Robert F. Smith told the newly minted graduates of Morehouse College that he would pay off their student loans, many people cheered their commencement speaker’s generosity and hailed the students’ good fortune. But others eyed the move with skepticism, seeing his philanthropy as just part of a broken system that enables a few to get too rich while millions face economic hardship. A big debate over the value of philanthropy – whether it’s a force for good, a danger to society or somewhere between those extremes – is underway. It’s raising even bigger questions, like what it takes to build a better world and who gets to decide how to solve the toughest global problems. As a result, many, including my students, are becoming more critical regarding the billions the world’s richest people give away. The critics Most...Big Four Tech Giants Are Beast for Regulators to Tame Whitney Tilson's email to investors discussing his thoughts on the big four tech giants; Facebook may be tough beast for regulators to tameApple sued for anti-competitive practices as US Department of Justice considers antitrust probe Lawsuit claims 30% platform fee is unsustainable and has forced a shift in App Store offerings to favor free and inexpensive apps.

David Campbell, Binghamton University, State University of New York (THE CONVERSATION) The Binghamton University students taking a philanthropy class I’ve been teaching for years have made more than US$150,000 in grants to local charities since 2009. Because giving away money is a rewarding experience, the course has a long waitlist. In 2019, I noticed that something had changed. The students began to wonder whether giving away money might not be all unicorns and rainbows, but – at least sometimes – a bad thing. After they made their grants to help immigrants, address the opioid epidemic and provide locally grown food to poor families, one student nonetheless wrote in her final paper, “There is a lot of negativity that surrounds philanthropy.” It summed up a sentiment being voiced more often. After billionaire investor Robert F. Smith told the newly minted graduates of Morehouse College that he would pay off their student loans, many people cheered their commencement speaker’s generosity and hailed the students’ good fortune. But others eyed the move with skepticism, seeing his philanthropy as just part of a broken system that enables a few to get too rich while millions face economic hardship. A big debate over the value of philanthropy – whether it’s a force for good, a danger to society or somewhere between those extremes – is underway. It’s raising even bigger questions, like what it takes to build a better world and who gets to decide how to solve the toughest global problems. As a result, many, including my students, are becoming more critical regarding the billions the world’s richest people give away. The critics Most...', ""Big Four Tech Giants Are Beast for Regulators to Tame Whitney Tilson's email to investors discussing his thoughts on the big four tech giants; Facebook may be tough beast for regulators to tame"", ""Apple sued for anti-competitive practices as US Department of Justice considers antitrust probe Lawsuit claims 30% platform fee is unsustainable and has forced a shift in App Store offerings to favor free and inexpensive apps.

Inicialmente será como parte de un paquete de 130 dólares que incluye equipo para jugar y un pase para un amigo. Google anunció el servicio de juegos en marzo, sin dar muchos detalles. El jueves, dijo que comenzará las ventas por adelantado del paquete de edición limitada llamado ""Founder\'s Edition"", aunque no dijo cuántos habrá disponibles. Google no ofrecerá suscripciones sueltas por 10 dólares al mes sino hasta el próximo año. Stadia es el intento de Google por hacer que las consolas tradicionales de videojuegos como Xbox y PlayStation sean obsoletas. Los juegos se guardan en internet y los jugadores pueden usarlos en computadoras tradicionales con Chrome de Google, y Chromebooks con Chrome OS. Los jugadores también pueden usar los teléfonos Pixel de Google, pero no otros teléfonos con el sistema operativo Android. A diferencia de los juegos tradicionales, el servicio de streaming requiere una conexión sólida a internet para jugar. Al igual que las películas y la música, la industria de los videojuegos ha pasado del hardware y los juegos en formato físico a descargas digitales y streaming. Los creadores de las consolas más populares tienen sus propios servicios por suscripción, mientras que Apple planea lanzar uno a finales de año. En 2018 la industria de los videojuegos en Estados Unidos sumó 43.400 millones de dólares, 18% más que en 2017, de acuerdo con la firma de investigación NPD Group. Los videojuegos por streaming típicamente requieren una buena conexión a internet y más poder en las computadoras que simplemente ver un video, pues hay interacción en tiempo real entre los jugadores.

On Thursday, Google revealed details regarding its new video game service, Stadia.Google har competencia a consolas con Stadia NUEVA YORK (AP) — Google lanzará su servicio de streaming Stadia en noviembre para tratar de abrirse paso en la industria de los videojuegos. Inicialmente será como parte de un paquete de 130 dólares que incluye equipo para jugar y un pase para un amigo. Google anunció el servicio de juegos en marzo, sin dar muchos detalles. El jueves, dijo que comenzará las ventas por adelantado del paquete de edición limitada llamado ""Founder's Edition"", aunque no dijo cuántos habrá disponibles. Google no ofrecerá suscripciones sueltas por 10 dólares al mes sino hasta el próximo año. Stadia es el intento de Google por hacer que las consolas tradicionales de videojuegos como Xbox y PlayStation sean obsoletas. Los juegos se guardan en internet y los jugadores pueden usarlos en computadoras tradicionales con Chrome de Google, y Chromebooks con Chrome OS. Los jugadores también pueden usar los teléfonos Pixel de Google, pero no otros teléfonos con el sistema operativo Android. A diferencia de los juegos tradicionales, el servicio de streaming requiere una conexión sólida a internet para jugar. Al igual que las películas y la música, la industria de los videojuegos ha pasado del hardware y los juegos en formato físico a descargas digitales y streaming. Los creadores de las consolas más populares tienen sus propios servicios por suscripción, mientras que Apple planea lanzar uno a finales de año. En 2018 la industria de los videojuegos en Estados Unidos sumó 43.400 millones de dólares, 18% más que en 2017, de acuerdo con la firma de investigación NPD Group. Los videojuegos por streaming típicamente requieren una buena conexión a internet y más poder en las computadoras que simplemente ver un video, pues hay interacción en tiempo real entre los jugadores.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that the Technology Education and Literacy in Schools program pairs educators with technology professionals to teach computer science in schools that might not have been able to offer the subject. The partnership simultaneously trains teachers in the subject so they can take over instruction in two years. The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction says 17 teachers completed a state preparation program in computer science over the past five years. Fifty received regular licenses and 46 received emergency licenses or permits to teach computer science. The small numbers mean some students weren't getting exposed to the subject. ___ Information from: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, http://www.jsonline.comGet An Xbox Live Gold 12-Month Subscription On Sale For $40 Score a whole year of online play and exclusive deals on games for your Xbox One with this limited-time offer for Xbox Live Gold.PRIMECAP Management Buys Elanco Animal Health Inc, Pioneer Natural Resources Co, CVS Health ...

Inicialmente será como parte de un paquete de 130 dólares que incluye equipo para jugar y un pase para un amigo. Google anunció el servicio de juegos en marzo, sin dar muchos detalles. El jueves, dijo que comenzará las ventas por adelantado del paquete de edición limitada llamado ""Founder\'s Edition"", aunque no dijo cuántos habrá disponibles. Google no ofrecerá suscripciones sueltas por 10 dólares al mes sino hasta el próximo año. Stadia es el intento de Google por hacer que las consolas tradicionales de videojuegos como Xbox y PlayStation sean obsoletas. Los juegos se guardan en internet y los jugadores pueden usarlos en computadoras tradicionales con Chrome de Google, y Chromebooks con Chrome OS. Los jugadores también pueden usar los teléfonos Pixel de Google, pero no otros teléfonos con el sistema operativo Android. A diferencia de los juegos tradicionales, el servicio de streaming requiere una conexión sólida a internet para jugar. Al igual que las películas y la música, la industria de los videojuegos ha pasado del hardware y los juegos en formato físico a descargas digitales y streaming. Los creadores de las consolas más populares tienen sus propios servicios por suscripción, mientras que Apple planea lanzar uno a finales de año. En 2018 la industria de los videojuegos en Estados Unidos sumó 43.400 millones de dólares, 18% más que en 2017, de acuerdo con la firma de investigación NPD Group. Los videojuegos por streaming típicamente requieren una buena conexión a internet y más poder en las computadoras que simplemente ver un video, pues hay interacción en tiempo real entre los jugadores.

The added communities are: Alief, Kashmere Gardens, Magnolia Park-Manchester, Sunnyside and the portion of Fort Bend County inside Houston’s city limits. Turner’s administration will seek input from residents to develop “action plans” for each neighborhood, then put the plans before city council for approval. The additions double the reach of the program, called Complete Communities. It already covers Acres Homes, Gulfton, the Near Northside, Second Ward and Third Ward. All of the participating communities “still struggle with access to quality amenities and services,” Turner said at a news conference Thursday. “We selected five neighborhoods because they, like the pilot program neighborhoods before them, face real challenges and need our support,” Turner said. “The city's unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1981, but residents in these communities still struggle to find ways into the workforce.” Residents in three of the new communities are predominantly African American, a constituency that political analysts say will be key to Turner’s re-election chances this year.

The added communities are: Alief, Kashmere Gardens, Magnolia Park-Manchester, Sunnyside and the portion of Fort Bend County inside Houston’s city limits. Turner’s administration will seek input from residents to develop “action plans” for each neighborhood, then put the plans before city council for approval. The additions double the reach of the program, called Complete Communities. It already covers Acres Homes, Gulfton, the Near Northside, Second Ward and Third Ward. All of the participating communities “still struggle with access to quality amenities and services,” Turner said at a news conference Thursday. “We selected five neighborhoods because they, like the pilot program neighborhoods before them, face real challenges and need our support,” Turner said. “The city's unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1981, but residents in these communities still struggle to find ways into the workforce.” Residents in three of the new communities are predominantly African American, a constituency that political analysts say will be key to Turner’s re-election chances this year. He is seeking a second four-year term in November, but faces a stiff challenge from three other major candidates: Councilman Dwight Boykins, lawyer Tony Buzbee and businessman Bill King. “The core of the additions was Kashmere Gardens, Sunnyside and Fort Bend because that focuses on Turner’s base, and he knows to win re-election he needs really solid support in the African-American...Slack valued at over $20bn after going public Slack foregoes IPO to go public via direct listingEnterprise-Technology Companies Trigger Investor Zeal Slack Technologies Inc.’s soaring market debut on Thursday was the latest example of investors’ unquenchable appetite for tech companies building modern digital services for other businesses.Potential battery fires force Apple to recall 2015 15-inch MacBook Pros Laptops labelled mid-2015 to be sent away for a fortnight.Edited Transcript of VNCE earnings conference call or presentation 13-Jun-19 8:30pm GMT Q1 2019 Vince Holding Corp Earnings CallMeet your new chief of staff: An AI chatbot Navigator, the new project from the creators of Mailbox, launches with $12MIs Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) A Good Stock To Buy?

The added communities are: Alief, Kashmere Gardens, Magnolia Park-Manchester, Sunnyside and the portion of Fort Bend County inside Houston’s city limits. Turner’s administration will seek input from residents to develop “action plans” for each neighborhood, then put the plans before city council for approval. The additions double the reach of the program, called Complete Communities. It already covers Acres Homes, Gulfton, the Near Northside, Second Ward and Third Ward. All of the participating communities “still struggle with access to quality amenities and services,” Turner said at a news conference Thursday. “We selected five neighborhoods because they, like the pilot program neighborhoods before them, face real challenges and need our support,” Turner said. “The city's unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1981, but residents in these communities still struggle to find ways into the workforce.” Residents in three of the new communities are predominantly African American, a constituency that political analysts say will be key to Turner’s re-election chances this year. He is seeking a second four-year term in November, but faces a stiff challenge from three other major candidates: Councilman Dwight Boykins, lawyer Tony Buzbee and businessman Bill King. “The core of the additions was Kashmere Gardens, Sunnyside and Fort Bend because that focuses on Turner’s base, and he knows to win re-election he needs really solid support in the African-American..."", 'Slack valued at over $20bn after going public Slack foregoes IPO to go public via direct listing', 'Enterprise-Technology Companies Trigger Investor Zeal Slack Technologies Inc.’s soaring market debut on Thursday was the latest example of investors’ unquenchable appetite for tech companies building modern digital services for other businesses.', 'Potential battery fires force Apple to recall 2015 15-inch MacBook Pros Laptops labelled mid-2015 to be sent away for a fortnight.', 'Edited Transcript of VNCE earnings conference call or presentation 13-Jun-19 8:30pm GMT Q1 2019 Vince Holding Corp Earnings Call', 'Meet your new chief of staff: An AI chatbot Navigator, the new project from the creators of Mailbox, launches with $12M', 'Is Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) A Good Stock To Buy?
