The strong opening marks the sixth consecutive day of gains. Stocks are moving closer to erasing the 6.6% decline in May that was fueled by concerns about the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The rally in stocks started last week when the Federal Reserve signaled that it is open to cutting rates to stabilize the economy if trade disputes threaten the economic recovery. Investors grew more hopeful Monday after President Donald Trump suspended plans to impose tariffs on Mexican goods after the countries struck a deal on immigration. Trump also plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan later this month to discuss their ongoing trade war. Technology stocks led the early gains. Apple rose 1%, Cisco rose 1.5%, and Nvidia rose 1.5%. Banks helped push financial stocks higher as lower bond prices pushed treasury yields higher. The sector suffered in May as investors fled to the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower, threatening to reduce the profit banks make from loans. Higher yields help push interest rates higher, generating more profits. Bank of America rose 2%. A range of consumer-related stocks also posted gains. Amazon rose 1%, Nike rose 1.8% and Home Depot and General Motors rose 1.5%. They are among a wide range of companies that will likely suffer if trade wars escalate and economic growth slows. Tesla gained 3.4% ahead of its annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Elon Musk is expected to be asked about the company's stock price, which is down 36% this year.

(AP) — Tesla CEO Elon Musk is assuring the company's shareholders that the electric car maker is on pace to set manufacturing and sales records during its current quarter after a disappointing start this year. The forecast made Tuesday at Tesla's annual meeting provided a ray of hope amid worries about the company's long-term prospects. Those escalating concerns caused Tesla's stock price to fall to a three-year low of $176.99 last week before bouncing back. The shares climbed more than 3% to $224.40 in Tuesday's extended trading after Musk's prediction.

The strong opening marks the sixth consecutive day of gains. Stocks are moving closer to erasing the 6.6% decline in May that was fueled by concerns about the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The rally in stocks started last week when the Federal Reserve signaled that it is open to cutting rates to stabilize the economy if trade disputes threaten the economic recovery. Investors grew more hopeful Monday after President Donald Trump suspended plans to impose tariffs on Mexican goods after the countries struck a deal on immigration. Trump also plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan later this month to discuss their ongoing trade war. Technology stocks led the early gains. Apple rose 1%, Cisco rose 1.5%, and Nvidia rose 1.5%. Banks helped push financial stocks higher as lower bond prices pushed treasury yields higher. The sector suffered in May as investors fled to the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower, threatening to reduce the profit banks make from loans. Higher yields help push interest rates higher, generating more profits. Bank of America rose 2%. A range of consumer-related stocks also posted gains. Amazon rose 1%, Nike rose 1.8% and Home Depot and General Motors rose 1.5%. They are among a wide range of companies that will likely suffer if trade wars escalate and economic growth slows. Tesla gained 3.4% ahead of its annual shareholder meeting, where CEO Elon Musk is expected to be asked about the company's stock price, which is down 36% this year.

(AP) — A late addition to the Wisconsin state budget that makes it easier to sell Tesla vehicles in Wisconsin was targeted to win over the vote of a Republican state senator who sells Tesla parts and salvaged electric vehicles. Sen. Chris Kapenga is a longtime supporter of the Tesla provision. He is an accountant from Delafield but also owns Integrity Motorsports of Eagle, which sells Tesla parts and rebuilds and sells salvaged Teslas. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported on the connection. Kapenga tells the newspaper that isn't sure yet if he will vote for the budget. His support was seen as crucial for Republicans to have enough votes to pass the plan as scheduled Wednesday.

The Senate is scheduled to take the final votes on the budget Wednesday. Approval would send the budget on to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Republicans hold a 19-14 advantage in the Senate but a group of fiscal hawks in the GOP caucus don't support the budget. Sen. Chris Kapenga said Tuesday he's not sure if he'll vote for the spending plan. If Republicans lose Kapenga they'd fall one vote short of passage. Republicans inserted language in the budget Tuesday to appease Kapenga. The provisions would allow electric car manufacturer Tesla to open dealerships in Wisconsin. Kapenga owns a business that sells Tesla parts and salvaged electric vehicles. Kapenga said at a news conference minutes before the Senate was set to convene that he has decided to vote for the budget. He stressed that he rebuilds Teslas as a hobby and sells the leftover parts. He says his endeavors don't yield any profits. ___ 8:40 a.m. The Wisconsin Senate is set to take the final votes on the next state budget.
