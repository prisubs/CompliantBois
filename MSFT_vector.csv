Richard Forno, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (THE CONVERSATION) The people of Baltimore are beginning their fifth week under an electronic siege that has prevented residents from obtaining building permits and business licenses – and even buying or selling homes. A year after hackers disrupted the city’s emergency services dispatch system, city workers throughout the city are unable to, among other things, use their government email accounts or conduct routine city business. In this attack, a type of malicious software called ransomware has encrypted key files, rendering them unusable until the city pays the unknown attackers 13 bitcoin, or about US$76,280. But even if the city were to pay up, there is no guarantee that its files would all be recovered; many ransomware attacks end with the data lost, whether the ransom is paid or not. Similar attacks in recent years have crippled the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk and local, county and state governments across the U.S. and Canada. These types of attacks are becoming more frequent and gaining more media attention. Speaking as a career cybersecurity professional, the technical aspects of incidents like this are but one part of a much bigger picture. Every user of technology must consider not only threats and vulnerabilities, but also operational processes, potential points of failure and how they use technology on a daily basis. Thinking ahead, and taking protective steps, can help reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents on both individuals and organizations.

Richard Forno, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (THE CONVERSATION) The people of Baltimore are beginning their fifth week under an electronic siege that has prevented residents from obtaining building permits and business licenses – and even buying or selling homes. A year after hackers disrupted the city’s emergency services dispatch system, city workers throughout the city are unable to, among other things, use their government email accounts or conduct routine city business. In this attack, a type of malicious software called ransomware has encrypted key files, rendering them unusable until the city pays the unknown attackers 13 bitcoin, or about US$76,280. But even if the city were to pay up, there is no guarantee that its files would all be recovered; many ransomware attacks end with the data lost, whether the ransom is paid or not. Similar attacks in recent years have crippled the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk and local, county and state governments across the U.S. and Canada. These types of attacks are becoming more frequent and gaining more media attention. Speaking as a career cybersecurity professional, the technical aspects of incidents like this are but one part of a much bigger picture. Every user of technology must consider not only threats and vulnerabilities, but also operational processes, potential points of failure and how they use technology on a daily basis. Thinking ahead, and taking protective steps, can help reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents on both individuals and organizations.

Richard Forno, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (THE CONVERSATION) The people of Baltimore are beginning their fifth week under an electronic siege that has prevented residents from obtaining building permits and business licenses – and even buying or selling homes. A year after hackers disrupted the city’s emergency services dispatch system, city workers throughout the city are unable to, among other things, use their government email accounts or conduct routine city business. In this attack, a type of malicious software called ransomware has encrypted key files, rendering them unusable until the city pays the unknown attackers 13 bitcoin, or about US$76,280. But even if the city were to pay up, there is no guarantee that its files would all be recovered; many ransomware attacks end with the data lost, whether the ransom is paid or not. Similar attacks in recent years have crippled the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk and local, county and state governments across the U.S. and Canada. These types of attacks are becoming more frequent and gaining more media attention. Speaking as a career cybersecurity professional, the technical aspects of incidents like this are but one part of a much bigger picture. Every user of technology must consider not only threats and vulnerabilities, but also operational processes, potential points of failure and how they use technology on a daily basis.

David Campbell, Binghamton University, State University of New York (THE CONVERSATION) The Binghamton University students taking a philanthropy class I’ve been teaching for years have made more than US$150,000 in grants to local charities since 2009. Because giving away money is a rewarding experience, the course has a long waitlist. In 2019, I noticed that something had changed. The students began to wonder whether giving away money might not be all unicorns and rainbows, but – at least sometimes – a bad thing. After they made their grants to help immigrants, address the opioid epidemic and provide locally grown food to poor families, one student nonetheless wrote in her final paper, “There is a lot of negativity that surrounds philanthropy.” It summed up a sentiment being voiced more often. After billionaire investor Robert F. Smith told the newly minted graduates of Morehouse College that he would pay off their student loans, many people cheered their commencement speaker’s generosity and hailed the students’ good fortune. But others eyed the move with skepticism, seeing his philanthropy as just part of a broken system that enables a few to get too rich while millions face economic hardship. A big debate over the value of philanthropy – whether it’s a force for good, a danger to society or somewhere between those extremes – is underway. It’s raising even bigger questions, like what it takes to build a better world and who gets to decide how to solve the toughest global problems. As a result, many, including my students, are becoming more critical regarding the billions the world’s richest people give away. The critics Most...Big Four Tech Giants Are Beast for Regulators to Tame Whitney Tilson's email to investors discussing his thoughts on the big four tech giants; Facebook may be tough beast for regulators to tameApple sued for anti-competitive practices as US Department of Justice considers antitrust probe Lawsuit claims 30% platform fee is unsustainable and has forced a shift in App Store offerings to favor free and inexpensive apps.

David Campbell, Binghamton University, State University of New York (THE CONVERSATION) The Binghamton University students taking a philanthropy class I’ve been teaching for years have made more than US$150,000 in grants to local charities since 2009. Because giving away money is a rewarding experience, the course has a long waitlist. In 2019, I noticed that something had changed. The students began to wonder whether giving away money might not be all unicorns and rainbows, but – at least sometimes – a bad thing. After they made their grants to help immigrants, address the opioid epidemic and provide locally grown food to poor families, one student nonetheless wrote in her final paper, “There is a lot of negativity that surrounds philanthropy.” It summed up a sentiment being voiced more often. After billionaire investor Robert F. Smith told the newly minted graduates of Morehouse College that he would pay off their student loans, many people cheered their commencement speaker’s generosity and hailed the students’ good fortune. But others eyed the move with skepticism, seeing his philanthropy as just part of a broken system that enables a few to get too rich while millions face economic hardship. A big debate over the value of philanthropy – whether it’s a force for good, a danger to society or somewhere between those extremes – is underway. It’s raising even bigger questions, like what it takes to build a better world and who gets to decide how to solve the toughest global problems. As a result, many, including my students, are becoming more critical regarding the billions the world’s richest people give away. The critics Most...', ""Big Four Tech Giants Are Beast for Regulators to Tame Whitney Tilson's email to investors discussing his thoughts on the big four tech giants; Facebook may be tough beast for regulators to tame"", ""Apple sued for anti-competitive practices as US Department of Justice considers antitrust probe Lawsuit claims 30% platform fee is unsustainable and has forced a shift in App Store offerings to favor free and inexpensive apps.
